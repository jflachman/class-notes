Now it's time to collect your tools and begin. This page contains the setup guides for Windows. If you are on a Mac and have already completed the installs on the previous page, click Next to skip this page. Follow the instructions closely and do your best with the information you have—we know there's a lot to install!

### Before You Begin

First, create accounts for the following services, which you'll need throughout the course. Don't just create logins; job recruiters often scour these sites in search of job candidates, so be sure to provide at least a headshot and contact information.

    ![A screenshot shows the Slack interface.](imgs/InstallYourToolsOnWindows/Install-Slack3.1.jpg)
    
6.  Enter your email (the one that the Slack invite was sent to) and password.
    

## Git and Git Bash

1.  Go to the Git [Downloads Links to an external site.](https://git-scm.com/downloads) page. Select the download for Windows. It should automatically download the most up-to-date version.
    
2.  Select Next to progress through the installation until you get to the screen that asks you to choose a default editor for Git. Select "Use Visual Studio Code as Git's default editor."

    ![A screenshot shows the Git installation prompt for Windows.](imgs/InstallYourToolsOnWindows/Install-GitWindows2.4.jpg)
    

Any settings not mentioned here can be left in their default mode.

## GitHub Token Setup Guide

To complete the following steps, you'll need to sign up for an account on the [GitHub website Links to an external site.](https://github.com/) if you haven't already.

1.  Click your profile image in the top-right corner of the GitHub website, and choose Settings from the dropdown menu.
    
    ![A screenshot showing the profile menu with the Settings option](imgs/InstallYourToolsOnWindows/profile-then-settings.jpg)
    
2.  Scroll down and select "Developer settings" on the left, as shown in the following image:
    
    ![A screenshot displays various options under the Settings menu, including Developer settings.](imgs/InstallYourToolsOnWindows/tokensetup-developer-settings.jpg)
    
3.  Then click "Personal access tokens" from the left, as shown in the following image:
    
    ![A screenshot shows the Personal access tokens option under GitHub Apps.](imgs/InstallYourToolsOnWindows/tokensetup-personal-access-tokens.jpg)
    
4.  Click "Generate new token" in the upper right, configure for "No expiration," and check the "repo" box for full control of private repositories, to match the following image:
    
    ![A screenshot displays the New personal access token page, with the no expiration and repo options selected.](imgs/InstallYourToolsOnWindows/tokensetup-new-personal-access-token.jpg)
    
5.  After generating the token, leave the page open. You will need to use the token for authentication in a later step.
    

Next, open Git Bash and follow these steps:

1.  Enter the following code with your GitHub username, then hit Enter to set your git username.

`git config --global user.name <your_username>`

2.  Next, enter `git config --global user.password <your_token>` using your personal access token from the GitHub window left open in the previous step in place of a password, then hit Enter.
    
3.  Then, enter `git config --global user.email <your_email>` to set your git email.
    

Nice work! You have now completed the Token Setup. As you will learn, GitHub is a collaborative tool—you can pull any changes down to your local repository quickly and easily, allowing you to easily share different versions of your code across workstations and to easily checkout and test those versions on your local computer.

## GitLab SSH Key Setup Guide

In order to use GitLab to access course materials, you will need to complete the following steps to setup an SSH key. Before beginning these steps, make sure you have access to your class GitLab account. You should have received an email with an invitation to your GitLab course page. If you haven't seen this email yet, please check your "Spam" folder first. In case it's not there, don't hesitate to contact your Student Success Advisor (SSA) to secure your access. Once you have access to your account, you can proceed with the SSH key setup.

1.  Open Git Bash.
    
2.  To make sure you don’t already have a set of keys on your computer, type the following in your Bash window. **Note:** Copying and pasting will not work!
    
    `ls –al ~/.ssh`
    
    -   If no keys pop up, move on to Step 3.
        
    -   If keys do pop up, check that none of them are listed under `id_rsa`, like in this image:
        
        ![SSHKeyWindows1](imgs/InstallYourToolsOnWindows/Install-SSHKeyWindows1.png)
        
    -   If you find a key named id\_rsa, you may either overwrite it by following the subsequent steps or use your existing key, which will be referenced in Step 8. If you choose not to overwrite it, remember the password associated with your key.
        
3.  Enter the following command along with your email to generate your keys.
    
    `ssh-keygen –t rsa`
    
4.  When prompted to enter a file to save the key, press **Enter**, and then enter a passphrase for your key. **Note:** You shouldn’t see any characters appear in the window while typing the password. When you’re finished, your window should look like this:
    
    ![SSHKeyWindows2](imgs/InstallYourToolsOnWindows/ssh-keygen1.png)
    
5.  Link your key to your machine using a tool called the ssh-agent. Run the following command in Bash to test whether the ssh-agent is running on your machine: `eval "$(ssh-agent –s)"`. Your Bash window should look like the following:
    
    ![SSHKey-Windows2](imgs/InstallYourToolsOnWindows/ssh-keygen2.png)
    
6.  Run the following command: `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`
    
7.  When prompted, enter the passphrase associated with the key. **Note:** If you’ve forgotten this key, go back to Step 3.
    
8.  To add the key to GitHub, copy the key to your clipboard by entering the following command:
    
    `clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
    
    ![SSHKey-Windows3](imgs/InstallYourToolsOnWindows/ssh-keygen3.png)
    

-   You shouldn’t see any kind of message when you run this command. If you do, make sure you entered it correctly.
    
-   **Note:** Do not copy anything else to your clipboard until all steps are completed. Otherwise, you’ll need to enter the copy command again.
    

9.  Go to GitLab's [SSH key preferences Links to an external site.](https://git.bootcampcontent.com/~/profile/keys).
    
10.  When the form pops up, enter a name for your computer in the Title input. In the Key input, paste the SSH key you copied in Step 8.
    
11.  Great work! You have now configured your SSH Keys with your GitLab account, streamlining authorization when accessing content in future class sessions.
    

## VS Code

1.  Go to the [setup page Links to an external site.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) on the VS Code website and select Windows as your platform.
2.  When the download is complete, run the installer file (VSCodeSetup-version.exe).
3. Go to the [DU VSCode steup page](1.3_vs_code_setup.md) for additional configuration information

**note**

For a 64-bit machine, VS Code is installed under `C:\Program Files \(x86\)\Microsoft VS Code`.

Great work on your Windows installations!
